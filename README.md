# Pizza Club Analysis
My friends and I have been going around our city trying out pizzas of different pizza places and rating them. I decided to use Python and such to get the analytics behind the ratings.

Source csv's are not included at the moment as they contain my friends names. I will likely include anonymous csv's later on though.
